# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a tic-tac-toe game that lets two players click in the squares to change their inner text to either an X or an O. The game then checks to see if any of the possible win conditions is met and then displays which player won or displays that it was a tie/draw.

This uses JS and some BootStrap elements to build a page and fill in the needed HTML with each event that occurs.

The game updates the current state of the board and displays it after each event(click) that happens.
